I'm so glad you're joining me today for a stroll through LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes. Get ready to step back in time and immerse yourselves in the vibrant history and cultural heritage of Mexican Americans in Los Angeles.\n\n**(Sound of footsteps on pavement)**\n\nBefore we dive in, take a look around. The location itself is significant. We're standing on the very spot where El Pueblo de Los Angeles was founded way back in 1781! This area was the heart of the city for a long time, the center of life for generations of Angelenos.\n\n**(Slight pause)**\n\nNow, LA Plaza, as it's affectionately known, isn't just about dusty old artifacts. It's a living, breathing space that celebrates the contributions of Mexican Americans to the arts, music, food, and so much more. It\u2019s a place where stories are told, traditions are honored, and creativity flourishes.\n\n**(Sound of gentle water feature)**\n\nWe'll start our tour by exploring the outdoor spaces. Notice the stunning landscaping? It\u2019s designed to reflect the diverse ecosystems of Southern California, but it's also a visual reminder of the connection to the land, a central theme in Mexican American culture. We can stop along the way to take photos and explore the area in your own time too.\n\n**(Pause, allowing for sounds of the environment)**\n\nLet's talk for a moment about the buildings themselves. We'll be focusing on two historic structures: the Vickrey-Brunswig Building and the Plaza House. They were both vital parts of the city's commercial life for decades, and they've been beautifully restored to house LA Plaza's exhibits. Fun fact: The Vickrey-Brunswig Building was once a major wholesale drug company! Can you imagine what it must have been like with all the different medicines and potions being created?\n\n**(Sound of footsteps on pavement again)**\n\nNow, as we move towards the Plaza House, keep an eye out for the murals. Murals are a powerful form of artistic expression, especially within the Chicano and Mexican American communities. They often depict historical events, cultural icons, and social justice themes. They tell a story, often a story that wasn't being told anywhere else.\n\n**(Pause)**\n\nInside the Plaza House, you\u2019ll find compelling exhibitions showcasing a variety of topics, from the history of ranching in Southern California to the evolution of Mexican American music. We'll delve into the lives of ordinary people, exploring their struggles, their triumphs, and their enduring spirit. And don\u2019t forget to check the schedule for workshops and special events! LA Plaza is always buzzing with activity.\n\n**(Pause)**\n\nOne of my favorite things about LA Plaza is how it connects the past to the present. It's not just about remembering history; it's about understanding how that history shapes our lives today. It's a place for dialogue, for learning, and for celebrating the richness and complexity of Mexican American culture.\n\n**(Sound of music begins to fade in slightly)**\n\nWe'll wrap up the official tour here. But please, explore on your own, ask questions, and soak it all in. Before you go, be sure to check out the gift shop! You can find some beautiful and unique souvenirs there.\n\n**(Music fades up and then out)**\n\nThanks for joining me today! I hope you've enjoyed your visit to LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes. Adios!",

Notice the\u2026 well, the distinct lack of a mural! And that\u2019s kind of the point. This space is dedicated to exploring and understanding the story behind one of the most controversial and ultimately hidden public artworks in Los Angeles history: David Alfaro Siqueiros\u2019s \u201cAm\u00e9rica Tropical.\u201d\n\nNow, you might be asking, \"Siqueiros? Never heard of him!\" Well, he was one of the \"big three\" of Mexican muralism, along with Diego Rivera and Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco. He was a fiery revolutionary, a passionate artist, and\u2026 let's just say he wasn't afraid to stir things up.\n\nIn 1932, Siqueiros was commissioned to paint a mural on this very wall. The mural was supposed to be a beautiful, idyllic scene of tropical life. But Siqueiros, being Siqueiros, had other ideas.\n\nWhat he created was anything BUT idyllic. \"Am\u00e9rica Tropical\" depicted a crucified indigenous man under an American eagle, with scenes of oppression and revolution around him. It was a stark critique of American imperialism and the exploitation of indigenous people. Powerful stuff, right?\n\nYou can imagine how well THAT went down in 1930s Los Angeles! The mural was almost immediately whitewashed \u2013 covered up completely. For decades, it remained hidden, a secret history literally plastered over.\n\nAnd that's why this center is so important. It's dedicated to uncovering that history. Inside, you'll find exhibits that explore Siqueiros's life and work, the context of 1930s Los Angeles, and the painstaking process of restoring the mural.\n\nInterestingly, the whitewashing actually helped preserve the mural. Think of it like putting a blanket over something to protect it from the sun. In this case, the whitewash acted as a buffer against the elements, allowing conservators to eventually bring parts of the mural back to life. You can see some of the revealed sections just above us.\n\nSo, let\u2019s head inside and delve a little deeper, shall we? Prepare to be challenged, to be moved, and to see Los Angeles history in a whole new light. Any questions before we go in?\n\n(Pause for questions relating to the tour. Answer appropriately.
